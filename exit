      <h2>Information about the study</h2>
      <br />
      <br />

      <h3>
        We would like to provide more information about the study you just took
        part in.

        <br />
        <br />

        In this study, you assumed the role of a sandwich maker in a sandwich
        shop and you learned how to submit a sandwich order.
        <br />
        <br />

        You were also informed about the consequences of preparing sandwiches
        with errors and how that would affect the sandwich price.

        <br />
        <br />

        Our goal with this study is to understand your strategies to maximize
        the shop’s revenue.
        <br />
        <br />

        That is, we are interested in understanding whether you balance the
        quality and quantity of the sandwiches or if you prioritize one over the
        other.

        <br />
        <br />

        We are also interested in how the balance between quantity and quality
        is influenced by the frequency of feedback you receive and the
        incentives you are given.
        <br />
        <br />

        To explore this, you were randomly assigned to different conditions:
        some of you received feedback every three rounds, while others received
        it after each round.
        <br />
        <br />

        Additionally, some participants were given a variable payment based on
        the shop’s revenue, whereas others received a fixed payment unrelated to
        the shop’s revenue.

        <br />
        <br />

        <strong></strong>Thank you for participating in our decision-making
        study!
